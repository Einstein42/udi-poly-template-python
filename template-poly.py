    The Controller Class is the primary node from an ISY perspective. It is a Superclass
    of polyinterface.Node so all methods from polyinterface.Node are available to this
    class as well.

    Class Variables:
    self.nodes: Dictionary of nodes. Includes the Controller node. Keys are the node addresses
    self.name: String name of the node
    self.address: String Address of Node, must be less than 14 characters (ISY limitation)
    self.polyConfig: Full JSON config dictionary received from Polyglot for the controller Node
    self.added: Boolean Confirmed added to ISY as primary node
    self.config: Dictionary, this node's Config

    Class Methods (not including the Node methods):
    start(): Once the NodeServer config is received from Polyglot this method is automatically called.
    addNode(polyinterface.Node, update = False): Adds Node to self.nodes and polyglot/ISY. This is called
        for you on the controller itself. Update = True overwrites the existing Node data.
    updateNode(polyinterface.Node): Overwrites the existing node data here and on Polyglot.
    delNode(address): Deletes a Node from the self.nodes/polyglot and ISY. Address is the Node's Address
    longPoll(): Runs every longPoll seconds (set initially in the server.json or default 10 seconds)
    shortPoll(): Runs every shortPoll seconds (set initially in the server.json or default 30 seconds)
    query(): Queries and reports ALL drivers for ALL nodes to the ISY.
    getDriver('ST'): gets the current value from Polyglot for driver 'ST' returns a STRING, cast as needed
    runForever(): Easy way to run forever without maxing your CPU or doing some silly 'time.sleep' nonsense

                  which never happens.
